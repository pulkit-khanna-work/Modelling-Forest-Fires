<h1> General Info </h1>
The data used in the experiments was collected from January 2000 to December 2003
and it was built using two sources. The first database was collected by the inspector that
was responsible for the Montesinho fire occurrences. At a daily basis, every time a forest
fire occurred, several features were registered, such as the time, date, spatial location, the type of vegetation involved,
the six components of the FWI system and the total burned area. The second database
was collected by the Braganc ̧a Polytechnic Institute, containing several weather
observations (e.g. wind speed) that were recorded with a 30 minute period by a meteorological station 
located in the center of the Montesinho park. The two databases were stored in tens of individual spreadsheets,
under distinct formats, and a substantial manual effort was performed to integrate them
into a single dataset with a total of 517 entries.

For more information, read [Cortez and Morais, 2007].
1. X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
2. Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
3. month - month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec'
4. day - day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun'
5. FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
6. DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3
7. DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6
8. ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
9. temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100
11. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40
12. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4
13. area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84
(this output variable is very skewed towards 0.0, thus it may make
sense to model with the logarithm transform).
